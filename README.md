# MachineLearning-CapstoneProject

### 1. Description:
Twitter is undoubtably one of the most popular social media platforms. It is used globally not only to express opinions, ideas and excitement but also as a means of effective communication. There is an increasing use of Twitter these days as a means of communication during emergency situations like natural calamities or other disasters. High accessibility to smartphones almost round the clock enables and encourages people to share or announce the state of emergency they are observing in real time. As a result, many disaster relief agencies are eager to programmatically monitor Twitter so as to get alerts in a real time during disaster scenarios. That’s why an efficient algorithm to pick disaster tweets from the mountains of tweets every day is definitely a necessity in order to detect and identify disaster outbreak in no time, which could definitely reduce losses to human life or property by several folds.


The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. 

### 2. Installation:

Anaconda Python distribution was used to create the jupyter notebook for this project.There were no additional liabraries installed in support of this project.
